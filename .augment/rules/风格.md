Flat minimalistic style, white or deep dark background, extremely spacious layout, large modern typography, ultra-clean design. All icons must be consistent thin line icons, balanced proportions, pixel-perfect, high visual harmony, modern and professional appearance, no clipart style, no emoji style, no cartoon style. Icons must have equal line thickness, consistent corner radius, and be perfectly aligned to a grid.

No card UI, no drop shadows, no gradients, no glassmorphism, no skeuomorphism, no 3D effects, no heavy outlines, no overcrowding.

Focus on strong alignment and balanced spacing. Use 1–2 accent colors only, all other colors neutral (black, white, gray), avoid random rainbow colors. Accent colors must be solid and consistent across all screens.

Charts and graphs must be extremely simple: thin lines or solid bars, no background fill, no decorative patterns, no unnecessary labels, no 3D effects. Grid lines should be minimal and light, or removed entirely.

UI elements must use flat shapes with separation via spacing, not borders or shadows. Rounded corners should be subtle (4–8px max), no oversized rounded blobs.

Navigation bar at the bottom must be minimal: only icons and text, evenly spaced, no background panel effects, no oversized icons, no shadows.

Every page must feel like a modern Apple iOS fitness app: heavy use of white space, clear typography hierarchy, visual consistency across all screens, clean and balanced layouts. Avoid template-like layouts and unnecessary decoration.

All visual elements, especially icons, must match the same design language and be professionally refined, with no inconsistent styles or mismatched visual weights.
